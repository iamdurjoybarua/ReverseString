# Reverse String (Java)

This Java program reverses a string entered by the user.

## Description

The program prompts the user to enter a string. It then uses the `StringBuilder` class's `reverse()` method to efficiently reverse the string. The reversed string is then printed to the console. The program includes a `try-finally` block to ensure that the `Scanner` resource is closed properly, preventing resource leaks.

## How to Compile and Run

1.  **Save the code:** Save the Java code as `ReverseString.java`.

2.  **Compile:** Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you saved the file. Compile the code using the Java compiler:

    ```bash
    javac ReverseString.java
    ```

3.  **Run:** After successful compilation, run the program:

    ```bash
    java ReverseString
    ```

4.  **Input:** The program will prompt you to enter a string. Type the string and press Enter.

5.  **Output:** The program will then display the reversed string.
